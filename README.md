# Poly-morph-Virus
A polymorphic virus for Linux (Ubuntu) that scans a folder for files with a specific letter in their names, renames them, encrypts them using XOR encryption, and changes their permissions to make them inaccessible. It also appends junk bytes to its binary after execution to evade basic antivirus detection.
